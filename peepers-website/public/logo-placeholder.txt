LOGO FILES NEEDED:

Please add your official Peepers crowned frog logo files to the /public directory:

1. /public/logo-full.png - Your complete logo with text (recommended size: 400x150px or similar aspect ratio)
2. /public/logo-icon.png - Just the crowned frog icon (recommended size: 200x200px square)

These files should be:
- High quality PNG format with transparent background
- Optimized for web use
- Your official branded logo files

The PeepersLogo component is now configured to use these files instead of the created SVG.

Once you add these files, the website will display your official logo properly.
