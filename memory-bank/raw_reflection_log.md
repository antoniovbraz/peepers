TaskRef: "Complete Peepers products page redesign with new brand identity"

Learnings:
- Successfully implemented comprehensive brand redesign for products page using new Peepers identity system
- Applied consistent color scheme (frog green #2d5a27, crown gold #f1c40f) throughout all components
- Integrated PeepersLogo component effectively in header, footer, and placeholder states
- Used new CSS utility classes (card-peepers, btn-primary, input-peepers, badge-new, badge-shipping) for consistent styling
- Enhanced UX with hover effects, transitions, and professional visual hierarchy
- Maintained all existing functionality while dramatically improving visual appeal
- Created cohesive design system that can be replicated across other pages

Difficulties:
- None encountered - the established brand foundation made implementation smooth and consistent

Successes:
- Complete transformation from generic blue/gray design to professional Peepers brand identity
- Seamless integration of logo component in multiple contexts (header, placeholders, etc.)
- Professional product cards with hover effects and persuasive badges
- Consistent color application across all UI elements
- Enhanced filters section with improved visual hierarchy
- Professional pagination and footer design
- Maintained responsive design and accessibility

Improvements_Identified_For_Consolidation:
- Brand redesign pattern: systematic replacement of generic colors with brand colors
- Component integration approach: using logo component in various contexts (header, placeholders, etc.)
- UX enhancement techniques: hover effects, transitions, visual hierarchy improvements

TaskRef: "Layout audit — replace inline SVGs, fix Footer and Produtos page, run dev validation"

Learnings:
- Replacing raw inline SVGs with lucide-react components removes sizing inconsistencies and centralizes icon styling. Implemented imports and replaced icons in:
  - Header: hamburger menu replaced with Menu/X from lucide-react
  - Footer: social icons and status badges replaced with Instagram, Facebook, MessageCircle, CheckCircle, Shield
  - Produtos page: refresh/reload icons replaced with RefreshCw
- Converting product thumbnails from raw <img> to next/image improves performance and enforces sizing constraints (explicit width/height required).
- Next.js on Windows + OneDrive can produce EINVAL readlink errors in .next build cache; deleting .next and restarting the dev server resolves those transient symlink errors.
- Tailwind/PostCSS integration for Tailwind v4+ requires the @tailwindcss/postcss adapter. After updating postcss.config.mjs to use '@tailwindcss/postcss' and installing autoprefixer/@tailwindcss/postcss, the CSS pipeline compiled correctly.
- Using component-level custom classes (e.g., .btn-primary, .card-hover) in globals.css within @layer components provides consistent fallbacks when Tailwind utility classes are absent or custom.
- TypeScript/JSX errors can arise from malformed JSX arrays/objects (I introduced and then fixed an extra stray brace in Footer socialLinks). Always validate saved file content after automated edits.
- Dev server warnings observed (metadata viewport/themeColor) are Next.js guidance: move viewport/themeColor exports to viewport when using the metadata API. These are warnings, not blockers, but should be addressed prior to production deployment.
- Fast Refresh required full reload a few times while fixing CSS/postcss issues; confirming a clean build after removing .next is essential.

Difficulties:
- Windows/OneDrive created a broken symlink situation in .next that caused dev server startup failures (EINVAL readlink). Required safe removal of .next and restarting Next to recover.
- A malformed edit introduced syntax errors in Footer (extra curly braces) which blocked TypeScript checks until corrected.
- Tailwind reported unknown utility classes initially due to postcss/tailwind plugin misconfiguration; resolved by installing adapter and verifying tailwind.config paths.

Successes:
- All inline SVGs in Header, Footer, and Produtos page have been replaced with lucide-react icon components.
- Product list images converted to next/image for improved loading and enforced sizing.
- PostCSS config updated to use @tailwindcss/postcss adapter; autoprefixer present — Next dev compiles successfully after cleaning .next.
- Resolved runtime TypeScript/JSX syntax errors in Footer.
- Confirmed dev server starts and serves pages (with Next.js metadata warnings that can be addressed separately).

Next Steps (short-term):
- Manually test the site in a browser at http://localhost:3000 (or 3001 if 3000 is occupied) across breakpoints: 320, 375, 768, 1024, 1440. Capture screenshots and check header/footer, product cards, and CTA buttons.
- Audit remaining files for any leftover raw <svg> or <img> tags (global search performed; most occurrences updated). Replace remaining instances if found.
- Address Next.js metadata warnings: move viewport and themeColor exports to viewport export as recommended by Next docs.
- Run a TypeScript check (npm run build or tsc) to catch any remaining typing issues.
- Commit changes to git (repo currently not initialized). Recommend initializing git and creating a feature branch before further edits.
- Consolidate key findings into memory-bank/consolidated_learnings.md and prune processed entries from this raw log per the Continuous Improvement Protocol.

Notes for documentation & Vercel/ML integration planning:
- Vercel hosting: prepare environment variables (ML app client_id, client_secret, webhook secret, NEXTAUTH_URL, any KV/DB URLs) in Vercel dashboard; set up automatic deployments from the repo.
- Mercado Libre API: you already created the ML app. Next steps will include documenting OAuth flow (authorization URL, callback route), token storage/refresh strategy, webhooks (order/items/questions), and scoped API endpoints used (items, users, orders).
- I'll draft an adjusted project documentation (README, API_SPEC.md updates, DELIVERY_PLAN.md) that covers Vercel deployment steps, environment variables, ML integration flows, and security considerations before we start implementing the backend integration.
